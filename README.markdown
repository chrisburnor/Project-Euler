# Project Euler Solutions

The Project Euler website has a wonderful collection of challenging and interesting technical problems that challenge programmers to think deeply and thoughtfully about their programming algorithms and thought processes.  The project can be found at [*Project Euler*](http://projecteuler.net/). 

I have chosen Python is the language to go through this with both because I would like to do more work in Python and gain more familiarity with the language and also because, although fast, its interpreted nature helps force one to think more carefully about good algorithms, less performance drop to unusuable.
