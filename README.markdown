# Project Euler Solutions

The Project Euler website has a wonderful collection of challenging and interesting technical problems that challenge programmers to think deeply and thoughtfully about their programming algorithms and thought processes.  The project can be found at [*Project Euler*](http://projecteuler.net/). 

These are simply here as a reference to anyone looking for alternative solutions/strategies to the problems.  Please do not use these to simply 'get' the answer or, even worse, copy and paste them.  This sort of defeats the entire purpose of the exercises and would be to your detriment.  The example in the Project Euler introduction says it best: You wouldn't copy and paste a cross-word puzzle solution and claim to have 'done' the puzzle, would you?

I have chosen Python is the language to go through this with both because I would like to do more work in Python and gain more familiarity with the language and also because, although fast, its interpreted nature helps force one to think more carefully about good algorithms, less performance drop to unusable.  Also Python is beautiful and fun to use!
